# EconomicAgreement

**rdfs:label:** Economic Agreement  
**rdf:type:** owl:Class  

## Definition
An Economic Agreement is a bundle of related Contracts negotiated and governed together between participating Economic Agents, typically representing a long-term or overarching arrangement that spans multiple specific contracts.

## Intended Meaning
Represents the highest level of business commitment structure within REA.  
While a Contract governs one or more Commitments, an Economic Agreement governs one or more Contracts, providing the legal, temporal, or policy context that binds them together.

## Key Characteristics
- Aggregates a set of **Contracts** under common terms or governance.  
- May define **general policies**, **time spans**, or **umbrella conditions** that apply to all subordinate contracts.  
- Specifies participating **Economic Agents** and global constraints.  
- Often used to represent frameworks such as master supply agreements, franchise agreements, or multi-year service agreements.

## Related
- `governs` (Economic Agreement → Contract)  
- `partyTo` (Economic Agent ↔ Economic Agreement)  
- `Policy` (constraints referenced by the agreement)  
- `Contract` (subordinate entity governed by the agreement)

## Notes
- Analogous to “framework contract” or “master agreement” in commercial law.  
- Supports hierarchical composition of commitments: **Agreement → Contract → Commitment → Event**.  
- Useful for modeling long-term business relationships with recurring contracts.
