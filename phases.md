# REA / ISO 15944-1 Transaction Phases

**rdfs:label:** Transaction Phases  
**rdf:type:** owl:Class

## Definition
The REA/ISO 15944-1 transaction model identifies five phases—planning, identification, negotiation, actualization, and post-actualization—describing the lifecycle of a business transaction.

## The Five Phases (ISO 15944-1 wording)

### **1. Planning Phase**
- Establishes goals and strategies for the economic exchange.  
- Determines what resources or commitments will be involved.  
- Is typically unilateral at first (internal to each agent).

### **2. Identification Phase**
- Each party identifies the other party as a potential trading partner.  
- Determines viability, compatibility, and prerequisites for transacting.

### **3. Negotiation Phase**
- Parties exchange proposals and counter-proposals.  
- Results in a *mutually agreed-upon commitment* (contract-level agreement).  
- Ends with acceptance or rejection.

### **4. Actualization Phase**
- Execution of the commitments through **Economic Events** (give/take/use/consume/produce).  
- Resources change ownership or condition.  
- Obligations and claims are fulfilled or updated.

### **5. Post-Actualization Phase**
- Validation, assessment, and closure activities.  
- Includes settlement, dispute resolution, auditing, or follow-up commitments.  
- Ensures the transaction is appropriately recorded and finalized.
